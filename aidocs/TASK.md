# MVP Advertising Dashboard Task

## Project Overview

Build a minimal viable product (MVP) of an advertising dashboard that demonstrates your ability to rapidly build a functional product using AI tools and/or no-code/low-code platforms.

## Key Requirements

### Authentication

- Implement basic or mocked user authentication/login

### Ad Campaign Creation

- Allow users to upload ad banners (image file or URL)
- Implement audience targeting selection:

  - Location
  - Interests (use mock data)
- Create campaign submission functionality (simulate with logs or saved data)

### Campaign Management

- Display a list of campaigns showing:
  - Campaign name
  - Date
  - Status
  - Targeting information

## Technical Guidelines

- Use AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, Replit, etc.
- Choose any preferred tech stack (React, Next.js, Flask, low-code tools, etc.)
- Focus on working functionality rather than UI/UX polish
- Upload code to GitHub with README describing the project and AI usage
- Provide a demo link if possible

## Bonus Features

- AI-powered functionality (e.g., AI-generated ad copy)
- Simulated analytics (e.g., fake impressions or CTR)
- Document how AI accelerated the development process

## Deliverables

- GitHub repository with complete code
- README documentation
- Demo link (if available)
- Submit all materials to <hr@alemx.com>

## Time Estimation
