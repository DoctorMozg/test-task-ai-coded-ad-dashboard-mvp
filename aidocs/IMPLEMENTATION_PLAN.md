# Implementation Plan for Advertising Dashboard MVP

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Advertising Dashboard MVP using Streamlit, in-memory storage, and OpenRouter.ai integration. The plan is optimized for rapid development (5 hours or less) with AI/Cursor assistance while maintaining core functionality.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Python Environment**
   - Python 3.13 as specified in pyproject.toml
   - UV for dependency management
   - Minimal pre-commit setup

2. **Project Structure**
   - Initialize simplified project structure
   - Set up essential directories and files
   - Configure Streamlit environment

3. **Version Control**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Basic .gitignore for Python/Streamlit

## Hour 1: Project Setup & Core Structure

1. **Data Models Implementation**
   - Create essential Pydantic models
   - Implement simple in-memory storage class
   - Add basic validation logic

2. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up Streamlit application
   - Configure project dependencies
   - Create basic file structure

## Hour 2: Authentication & Basic UI

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement simple session-based authentication
   - Set up basic user login/registration
   - Integrate with Streamlit session state

2. **Basic UI Scaffolding**
   - Set up main Streamlit app with navigation
   - Create login and registration pages
   - Implement basic dashboard layout

## Hour 3: Campaign Management

1. **Campaign Creation**
   - Build streamlined campaign creation form
   - Implement simplified target audience selection
   - Add basic image upload functionality

2. **Campaign Management**
   - Develop campaign list view
   - Add simple campaign editing functionality
   - Create mock campaign data for testing

## Hour 4: AI Integration & Analytics

1. **OpenRouter.ai Integration**
   - Set up OpenRouter.ai API integration
   - Implement campaign name suggestion feature
   - Add simple ad copy generation functionality

2. **Analytics Implementation**
   - Create mock data for analytics
   - Build basic performance visualizations
   - Implement simple metrics display

## Hour 5: Refinement & Documentation

1. **Testing**
   - Test core functionality
   - Fix critical issues
   - Validate user flows

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete README with setup instructions
   - Document AI usage
   - Prepare for demonstration

## AI/Cursor Optimization Strategy

- Use AI to generate boilerplate code and data models
- Leverage Streamlit components library for UI elements
- Use pre-built visualization templates
- Generate mock data with AI
- Have AI optimize queries and data handling
- Use AI for documentation generation

## MVP Feature Prioritization

1. User authentication (simplified)
2. Campaign creation and management
3. Basic analytics display
4. AI name suggestion feature
5. Simple ad copy generation

## Success Criteria

1. Core MVP features implemented and functional
2. Simple, intuitive UI
3. Reliable in-memory data management
4. Working OpenRouter.ai integration
5. Basic documentation
6. Functional demo-ready codebase

This streamlined implementation plan focuses on delivering the most valuable features within a 5-hour timeframe by leveraging AI assistance and prioritizing essential functionality.
