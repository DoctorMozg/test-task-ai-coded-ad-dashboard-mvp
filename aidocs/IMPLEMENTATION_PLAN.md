# Implementation Plan for Advertising Dashboard MVP

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Advertising Dashboard MVP using Streamlit, in-memory storage, and OpenRouter.ai integration. The plan is optimized for efficient development with AI/Cursor assistance while maintaining core functionality. The 5-hour timeframe may be challenging given comprehensive requirements - consider expanding to 6-8 hours or reducing scope to focus on core functionality.

See [TASK.md](./TASK.md) for original task description and [FUNCTIONALITY.md](./FUNCTIONALITY.md) for detailed functional requirements.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Python Environment**
   - Python 3.13 as required (enforce in pyproject.toml)
   - UV for dependency management (no pip allowed)
   - Pre-commit hooks with Ruff linting and formatting

2. **Project Structure**
   - Initialize project structure following [STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md)
   - Set up essential directories for UI components, data models, and services
   - Configure Streamlit environment with proper page organization

3. **Version Control**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Comprehensive .gitignore for Python/Streamlit

## Hour 1: Project Setup & Core Data Models

1. **Data Models Implementation**
   - Create essential Pydantic models with Schema postfix as specified in [MODEL.md](./MODEL.md)
   - Implement Annotated[Type, Field(...)] syntax for all fields
   - Use UUIDs for entity IDs
   - Add comprehensive validation logic
   - Implement TypedDict where appropriate

2. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up Streamlit application with proper structure
   - Configure project dependencies in pyproject.toml
   - Create modular file structure following [STRUCTURE.md](./STRUCTURE.md)

## Hour 2: Authentication & Storage Implementation

1. **Authentication System**
   - Implement PBKDF2 password hashing as detailed in [AUTH.md](./AUTH.md)
   - Set up session-based authentication with Streamlit session state
   - Create clear separation between public and protected views
   - Implement proper session management

2. **Storage Implementation**
   - Create dictionary-based stores with consistent patterns as outlined in [DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md)
   - Implement proper indexing for efficient lookups
   - Add memory limits for all collections
   - Create helper methods for common query patterns
   - Implement error handling for all storage operations

## Hour 3: Campaign Management & UI

1. **Campaign Creation**
   - Build step-by-step campaign creation form following [CAMPAIGN.md](./CAMPAIGN.md)
   - Implement target audience selection with validation
   - Add image upload with proper validation
   - Ensure responsive UI by optimizing data operations as described in [UI.md](./UI.md)

2. **Campaign Management**
   - Develop campaign list view with filtering
   - Add campaign editing functionality
   - Implement consistent status workflow
   - Create realistic mock campaign data

## Hour 4: AI Integration & Analytics

1. **OpenRouter.ai Integration**
   - Set up OpenRouter.ai API with environment variables for security
   - Implement campaign name suggestion feature
   - Add ad copy generation functionality
   - Add retry logic for failed API requests
   - Implement caching for AI responses to limit API calls

2. **Analytics Implementation**
   - Generate realistic mock data for demonstration
   - Build performance visualizations with appropriate chart types as specified in [ANALYTICS.md](./ANALYTICS.md)
   - Implement date range filtering
   - Format metrics appropriately (percentages, currency)
   - Keep calculations efficient using st.cache_data

## Hour 5: Testing, Validation & Documentation

1. **Testing & Validation**
   - Test all user inputs with comprehensive validation
   - Provide clear feedback for validation errors
   - Verify memory usage for larger datasets
   - Test all workflows end-to-end
   - Manual testing of core functionality

2. **Documentation & Refinement**
   - Complete README with setup instructions
   - Document AI usage and limitations
   - Add inline documentation for complex functions
   - Fix any critical issues identified in testing
   - Prepare for demonstration

## AI/Cursor Optimization Strategy

- Use AI to generate Pydantic models following project conventions in [MODEL.md](./MODEL.md)
- Leverage pre-built Streamlit components for UI elements as described in [UI.md](./UI.md)
- Generate realistic mock data with AI assistance
- Use AI to optimize storage queries and data handling following [DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md)
- Implement AI-assisted error handling patterns

## MVP Feature Prioritization

1. User authentication with PBKDF2 and proper session management as specified in [AUTH.md](./AUTH.md)
2. Campaign creation and management with validation according to [CAMPAIGN.md](./CAMPAIGN.md)
3. Analytics display with appropriate visualizations following [ANALYTICS.md](./ANALYTICS.md)
4. AI name suggestion with proper security
5. Ad copy generation with caching

## Success Criteria

1. Core MVP features implemented and functional as outlined in [FUNCTIONALITY.md](./FUNCTIONALITY.md)
2. Clean, responsive UI following Streamlit best practices in [UI.md](./UI.md)
3. Reliable in-memory data management with proper indexing as described in [DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md)
4. Secure OpenRouter.ai integration with environment variables
5. Comprehensive input validation
6. Functional demo-ready codebase

This implementation plan addresses the specific requirements from all documentation files while maintaining a focus on delivering the most valuable features through efficient development patterns.
